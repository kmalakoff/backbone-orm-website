# Using our Project model from above
db = Project.db()

# Quick and easy table creation
db.ensureSchema (err) ->
  # The model's table will be created if it doesn't exist
  # Each field will have a corresponding column created if one does not exist
  # Join tables for manyToMany relations are created automatically

# Resetting a table
db.resetSchema (err) ->
  # The model's table will be dropped and recreated
  # Related join tables will be too

# Create a new table
# After createTable is called we can build up a schema to be executed in one call
db.createTable()
db.addColumn('a_column', 'String', {indexed: true, length: 500})
# Call end to execute the pending operations
db.end (err) ->
  # Table created
