BackboneORM and all of its variants were designed to provide a consistent and flexible interface across Node.js and the browser.

It was inspired by other great software and provides:

* Node.js-style callbacks and streams for a familiar asynchronous programming style
* MongoDB-like query language to easily slice-and-dice your data
* REST controller for browser search bar queires like CouchDB
