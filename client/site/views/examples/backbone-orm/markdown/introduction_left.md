BackboneORM was designed to provide a consistent, polystore ORM across Node.js and the browser.

It was inspired by other great software and provides:

* Node.js-style callbacks and streams for a familiar asynchronous programming style
* MongoDB-like query language to easily slice-and-dice your data
* a REST controller enabling browser search bar queries and an optional paging format like CouchDB
