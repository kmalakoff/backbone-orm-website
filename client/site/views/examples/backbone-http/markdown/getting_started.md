### Getting Started

When loading BackboneHTTP in the browser, you can use global script tags, AMD, or a broswerified bundle. Also, you should set up a [BackboneREST](./backbone-rest.html) controller in you Node.js server to provide a JSON API for BackboneHTTP to consume.

**Note:** depending on the way BackboneORM is loaded, you may need to access it differently. See below examples for details.
