### Introduction

BackboneHTTP provides an HTTP interface that can be used in the browser or from Node.js by using [Superagent](http://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/).

This allows for a iteration of remote collections from the browser using BackboneORM's unified query syntax and iteration methods.
