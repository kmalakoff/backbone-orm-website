### Selecting JSON Templates

You can use the `$template` option in your calls to request JSON rendered by specific templates by BackboneREST.

For example, you can request a relationship to be embedded in the response to avoid a second call for related models. If you need all the attributes in a relationship, you could alternatively use `include`.
