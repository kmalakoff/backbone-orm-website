### Relations

Backbone-ORM allows you to create relations to use with any backend. Naming conventions are as follows:

* belongsTo: A foreign key to the related model will be placed on this model
* hasOne: A foreign key to this model is placed on the related model
* hasMany: A foreign key to this model is placed on the related model, and the relation will return a set of models when accessed
* manyToMany: A join table is automatically created with foreign keys to each side of the relation.
