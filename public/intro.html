<p>First up, I&#39;d like to give a decent answer to this question.</p>

<p>BackboneORM is a bit more than just persistence for Backbone models - it was designed to make it super easy to get a
RESTful API up and running in Node and start consuming it from the client.</p>

<p>The various components each have a role to play here:</p>

<ul><li>BackboneORM is the core project. It manages relationships and does most of the fun, internal things.</li><li>BackboneMongo and BackboneSQL take care of persisting your models to (wait for it...) MongoDB and SQL stores.</li><li>BackboneREST lets you quickly generate RESTful web services from your models.</li><li>BackboneHTTP is a <em>client side</em> library for accessing these services. It shares the syntax of BackboneMongo and
BackboneSQL, but will hit up your REST endpoints rather than a database directly.</li></ul>

<p>So! Without further ado, let&#39;s make an app.</p>
